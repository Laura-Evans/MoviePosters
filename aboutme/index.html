	<h1><u>Who am I?</u></h1>

	<p>I am Laura Evans, a second year undergraduate student at <span class="highlight">Oxford Brookes University</span>. I am studying <span class="highlight">Media, Journalism and Publishing</span> with the intention of going into publishing. For university I live in Oxford but I grew up in Wiltshire. When at home I live five minutes away from the prehistoric monument <span class="highlight">Stonehenge.</span> I live there with my parents and my brother.</p>
    <img class="fact_image" src="../img/Stonehenge2.JPG">

	<p>I also have a Sprocker Spaniel called Rosie, she is very cute!</p>

  <h1><u>What do I like?</u></h1>

	<p>In my spare time I like to read, the genres that I tend to read are <span class="highlight">young adult</span> and <span class="highlight">fantasy</span>. I recently read the graphic novel <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864790-pumpkinheads?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=eV0VylGThb&rank=1" target="blank">Pumpkinheads</a></p>

	<p>I also watch a lot of TV shows on Netflix, Disney + and Amazon, some of my favourites are <span class="highlight">The Office, Brooklyn 99</span> and <span class="highlight">Gavin and Stacey</span>.</p>

  <p>During the COVID-19 lockdown I decided to <span class="highlight">learn a new language</span>, being half Welsh and having a fascination with Wales as a whole I’ve always wanted to learn the <span class="highlight">Welsh language</span>. So that’s what I decided to start learning. I have a <span class="highlight">200</span> day streak on Duolingo! Here’s a little Welsh: <span class="highlight">Dw i’n dysgu Cymraeg ond dw i’n ofnadwy!</span> I’ve also picked up an optional module in <span class="highlight">French</span> this semester, so I’m learning two languages at once which is hard!</p>

	<h1><u>My projects</u></h1>

	<p>I have a <span class="highlight">bookstagram</span> that I started back in January 2016 and I’ve recently decided to restart it. I have two new posts up and I’m hoping to add more soon! Here is the most recent picture I uploaded:
    <img class="fact_image" src="img/Pumpkinheads.jpg">

		<h1><u>What do I see myself doing in five years?</u></h1>

  <p>Like I said before I’m hoping to go into publishing, more specifically <span class="highlight">children’s</span> or <span class="highlight">young adult</span> publishing. For a while now I’ve really wanted to live in <span class="highlight">Edinburgh</span> as I love the city and have family that live in Scotland. So hopefully in five years I’ll be working for a publishing company in Edinburgh that specialises in children’s publishing. Or, as an alternative, to help develop my Welsh, I’d also love to work for a <span class="highlight">publishing company in Wales</span>.<p/>
