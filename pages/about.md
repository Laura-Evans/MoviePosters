Welcome to Behind The Page, a blog all about the typographical choices made on movie posters. 

There are many aspects that make up a good movie poster, one of which being the typeface. Having a good typeface can make or break a poster. So having a good typeface that matches the theme of the movie and is cohesive is vital when creating a successful movie poster.

There are multiple different genres in film and with those genres comes certain design choices that are synonymous with specific genres. For instance, action films will usually have quite dark colours with orange hues and sans-serif typefaces. Whereas horror films often have dark or black backgrounds with serif typefaces. The choice of typeface on a movie poster can tell the audience a great deal about what the movie is about and what they would expect.

Through socialisation we as humans have been conditioned to understand why certain design choices have been made and what those choices signify. It is through this process that we can understand why a serif font lends itself better to a lighter, more comedic film whereas a sans-serif lends itself better to films with for hard-hitting content. However, there can be exceptions to the rule. For example, the film *All The Money In The World* has two different widely used posters; one which uses a serif font and one which uses a sans-serif font. These stylistic choices will be used in different ways to invoke different emotions.

Typographical choices are a crucial aspect to think about when designing a film poster. You've got to make sure that the typeface you are using is signifying the right genre and invoking the right emotion is key to creating a successful, cohesive poster.
